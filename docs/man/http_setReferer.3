.SH "NAME"
.LP 
\fBhttp_setReferer\fR \- Sets the Referer shown to the server during an HTTP GET request.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.LP 
\fB#include <http_fetcher.h>\fR
.br 
.LP 
\fBint http_setReferer(const char *\fR\fInewReferer\fR\fB);
.br 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
The Referer field of an HTTP request tells the server what URL referred you to the current URL being requested.  By default, no Referer is sent.

Calling \fBhttp_setReferer\fR will cause \fInewReferer\fR to be sent as the Referer for subsequent requests (until the next call to \fBhttp_setReferer\fR).

If you pass in \fBNULL\fR as an argument, HTTP Fetcher will NOT give the server a Referer.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.LP 
On success, \fBhttp_setReferer\fR returns 0.

On error, \-1 is returned, and the previous value of
.br 
Referer is unchanged.  \fBhttp_perror\fR can be used to print an informative error message.  \fBhttp_strerror\fR can be used to get a pointer to the current error description message.
