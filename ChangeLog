1.1.0 - FIXME - Date here before release
	* Added the ability to transparently follow HTTP redirects, configurable
		with the new http_setRedirects() function.
    * Replaced direct reference to sys_errlist with a call to strerror, which
        allows the library to build on NetBSD.
    * Changed configure.in to configure.ac.  Autoconf seems to be happier.
    * Made the html docs a little less ugly.

1.0.3 - October 14, 2003
    * Added support for ports other than 80
    * HTTP control structures use RFC 1945 compliant linebreaks
    * Fixed bug where server response values with leading 0's were read as octal
    * Fixed error in timeout logic that prevented connections from actually
        timing out
    * Fixed possible realloc() related memory leak
    * Data is now NULL terminated for safety
    
1.0.2 - April 22, 2003
    * Fixed a buffer overflow (reported to BugTraq, see
        http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6531/info/) and a memory leak.
    * Check for hstrerror and provide workaround if not present.
    * Portability improvements, build process checks for necessary
        functions.
    * Includes specfile for building rpm packages.
    * Includes http-fetcher.m4 macro file for inclusion with autoconf

1.0.1 - July 30, 2001
    * Requests now include a "Host:" field to satisfy servers running virtual
        domains (who would otherwise return a 404).  Thanks for the help,
        zealot!
    * Libtool/project versioning also sorted out.

1.0.0 - July 4, 2001
    * Initial release.
