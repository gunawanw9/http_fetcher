Test program for HTTP Fetcher.

testfetch is a small, simple program that demonstrates basic use of the
HTTP Fetcher library.

Once you've installed HTTP Fetcher, testing it out with testfetch is simple:

    1) Type 'configure'
    2) Type 'make'
    3) Type 'testfetch'

You should receive a message saying that testfetch successfully downloaded
a web page.  Check out the source for simple use of HTTP Fetcher.

For a more in-depth example take a look at lfetch, a program that fully
utilizes HTTP Fetcher to implement a feature-rich HTTP download tool
(available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/lfetch)
